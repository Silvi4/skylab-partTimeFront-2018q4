# Markdown Practice [timing 30m]

## Goals

In this practice you will learn how to create a basic markdown file explaining what you learned in precourse
Upload README.md to Github

## Tasks

### **Step 0**: Create a file (via terminal) named README.md in the following path:

```
 skylab/precourse/README.md
```

Use *touch* to create the README.md

### **Step 1**: Open the file with VS Code

### **Step 2**: Use ‘#’ to create a first header of your Markdown and write the main title

```
# Concepts of Precourse
```

### **Step 3**: Add the seconds headers with ‘##’ and write the secondary titles with the name of different sections

```
## Javascript Basics
```

### **Step 4**: Add some explanation about each topic learnt during the precourse. Include links to the exercises done:

```
(topic exercise title)[link here]
```
(there are about 50+ links)

It could be a great idea to add some code examples with:

```
    ```javascript
    function() {
        ...
    }
    ```
```
### **Step 5**: Add links in the bottom of every topic to the project exercise related to it:

```
(topic final project exercise title)[link here]
```

(there are about 7+ links)
