## String Calculator

Define a function called `add` with a single argument `input`. The input to the function will be a string containing a comma-separated list of numbers. The function must return the sum of the numbers. e.g.

    add(1,2,3,4) // => 10


## Is palindrome?

Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not
A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.


## Matrix
[1,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0],
[0,0,1,0],
[0,0,0,1]
Write a JavaScript function which returns the n rows by n columns identity matrix.

## Second lowest and second greatest

Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively.

    Sample array : [1,2,3,4,5]
    Expected Output : 2,4 

## Perfect Numbers

Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.

> According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

> Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.


## Coinify

Write a JavaScript function to convert an amount to coins.

    Sample function : amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])
    Here 46 is the amount. and 25, 10, 5, 2, 1 are coins. 
    Output : 25, 10, 10, 1


## Occurences 

Write a JavaScript function to  get the number of occurrences of each letter in specified string.

````
Example:    input: Char_Counts('welcome')
            output: w: 1, e: 2, l: 1, c: 1, o:1, m: 1
```


##Bubble Sort algorithm

Write a JavaScript function to apply Bubble Sort algorithm. 

> Note : According to wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order". 

    Sample array : [12, 345, 4, 546, 122, 84, 98, 64, 9, 1, 3223, 455, 23, 234, 213]
    Expected output : [3223, 546, 455, 345, 234, 213, 122, 98, 84, 64, 23, 12, 9, 4, 1]


## Function name

Write a JavaScript function to get the function name.
